# What is a variable: Variables are labels which act as containers to hold values.In python a variable is always associated with some values. We use the assignment operator (=) to assign values to a variable.Anything that is inside of quotes in python is called a string
message= "Hello there hope everything is fine?"
print(message)

message2=" Goodbye!"
print(message2)

# concatenating variables(Joining two or more outputs together) you can only concatenate a string with a string
message3=message + message2
print(message3)

# variables can be named using a letter , number and an underscore, they can start with a letter and an inderscore but not with a number
name_1 = "Alice"
print(name_1)


# variable names can not contain spaces bt we can use underscore to separate names.
total_marks = 85
print( total_marks)

# variable names are not supposed to be keywords / reserved characters in python 
# for ="Nairobi"
# print(for)
